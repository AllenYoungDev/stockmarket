# Allen Young's Stockmarket Demo
An online private stockmarket web app for demonstrating Allen Young's frontend, backend, and full-stack web app development and deployment skills.

This is a small full-stack web app that enables purchasing one or more private shares of a company online.

PayPal is used as a payment processor.

Because the primary purpose of this web app is demonstrating Allen Young's web app development and deployment skills and know-how, this web app is implemented in different editions with different web-app development libraries, frameworks, and tools, and deployment automation software and platforms; that is, this web app has multiple implementations using different software development frameworks, libraries, and tools, and deployment automation software and platforms, for demonstrating Allen Young's web app software development and deployment skills and know-how.
