# Allen Young's Stockmarket Demo
An online private stockmarket web app for demonstrating Allen Young's frontend, backend, and full-stack web app development skills.

This is a small full-stack web app that enables purchasing one or more private shares of a company online.

PayPal is used as a payment processor.
